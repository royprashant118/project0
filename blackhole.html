    <h3>birth of a star</h3>
    <span>
        <p>
            <img src="star formation.jpg" width="18%" height="auto" style="vertical-align:top; float: right;">
            Stars are born in vast, slowly rotating, clouds of cold gas and dust called nebulae (singular nebula). These large clouds are enormous, they have masses somewhere between 100 thousand and two million times the mass of the Sun and their diameters range from 50 to 300 light years across.
            
            It is visible with the naked eye if the sky is dark enough. These clouds are so massive that they can collapse under their own gravity if they are disturbed. 
            Over time the clouds contract, become denser and slowly heat up. The clouds also break up into smaller clumps. As the clumps get smaller they begin to flatten out into a disk shape. The centre of each clump will eventually contain a star and the outer disk of gas and dust may eventually form planets around the star.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the contracting clump continues to heat up, a protostar is formed at the centre. A protostar is a dense ball of gas that is not yet hot enough at the centre to start nuclear reactions. This stage lasts for roughly 50 million years. As the collapse continues, the mass of the protostar increases, 
            squeezing it further and increasing the temperature. If the protostar is massive enough for the temperature to reach 10 million degrees Celsius, then it becomes hot enough for nuclear reactions to start and the protostar will will technically be referred to as a star.
        </p>
        <p>
            The young star starts converting hydrogen to helium via nuclear fusion reactions. Nuclear reactions in stars produce vast 
            amounts of energy in the form of heat and light, which is radiated into space. This energy production prevents the star from
            contracting further. As the star shines, the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star is slowly blown away by the star's stellar wind which leaves behind any planets if they have already formed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A star is considered to be 'born' once nuclear fusion reactions begin at its centre. Initially hydrogen is converted to helium deep inside the star. A star that is 
            converting hydrogen to helium is called a main sequence star. Stars spend most of their lives as main sequence stars, 
            converting hydrogen to helium at their centres or cores. A star may remain as a main sequence star for millions or billions of years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Main sequence stars have different masses and colours, depending on the temperatures of their surfaces. Look at the following picture and correctly label the temperatures of all the stars using the list of temperatures below. Which star represents our Sun?

                <img src="colour of star.png"  width="40%" height="auto" style="padding-right: 20px ;"><p class="imagetext">The colour blue corresponds to light at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) than the colour red. Shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) correspond to higher energies and thus hotter temperatures.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Death of a star</h3>
        <p>
            When the hydrogen in the centre of the star is depleted, the star's core shrinks and heats up. This causes the outer part of the star, the star's atmosphere, which is still mostly hydrogen, to start to expand.
            this is starting of death of a star.
            It goes by following phases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red giant</li>
            <li>planetary nebula</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Smaller stars then transforms to white dwarf then cools down to black dwarf.
            But in case of larger stars ending is not that simple. They went through a massive supernova explosion
            after that some turn into neutron star and some who has very high mass turns into blackhole due to their own gravity.
